# PyTorchFI Documentation

PyTorchFI is a runtime injection tool for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), an open-source deep learning platform developed by Facebook. A clean, robust, and versatile tool, it offers an easy way to implement fault injections within any PyTorchFI application.

## Getting started

This documentation serves as an outline and tutorial on how to get started with using PyTorchFI and the different functionality that it offers. First check out [setup](https://n3a9.github.io/pytorchfi-docs-beta/docs/setup/) to see how to integrate PyTorchFI to your project.
